PytorchAdversarialGym
=====================
**A PyTorch-integrated Gym environment for enabling and evaluating new research into attacking and defending neural networks with adversarial perturbations.**  While most research into adversarial perturbations has focused on gradient, decision boundary, or transferability methods, this environment generalizes the adversarial attack problem as a Markov decision process.  This allows for methods from reinforcement learning to be easily applied, a possibility that has only been rarely suggested or investigated in the ML security literature.  In the spirit of Gym, no assumptions are made about the structure of your agent; in particular, adversaries can be either MDP-aware or MDP-agnostic.

Note: Still in development, but this branch should be self-contained.
